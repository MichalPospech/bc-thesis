Reinforcement learning has been getting a lot of publicity in recent years, including competing with the best players in DotA 2 \cite{openai2019dota}, playing Texas hold'em poker \cite{Brown885} or mastering Go, chess, shogi and other games \cite{Schrittwieser2020}. Other than that reinforcement learning has been applied to many domains such as robot control \cite{openai2019solving}, energy consupmtion optimisation \cite{LISSA2021100043}, healthcare \cite{yu2020reinforcement} or autonomous driving \cite{kiran2021deep}. However most of the current research is focused on deep reinforcement learning while other potentially promising approaches are mostly ignored. This thesis focuses on exploring one of such approaches, evolutionary strategies.

In the first part the task of reinforcement learning is formally introduced using Markov decision processes along with several methods for solving the task. After that, evolutionary algorithms are described and are subsequently extended with evolutionary strategies which are the basis of the methods explored in this thesis. Finally evolutionary strategies applied on reinforcement learning problems are explored.
