The characterizing features that distinguish ES from other subclasses of EA are discussed as well.},

Though not comprising all degrees of freedom, it is richer in the number of features than the meanwhile old ($\mu$, $\lambda$) and ($\mu$+$\lambda$) versions. Finally, all important theoretically proven facts about evolution strategies are briefly summarized and some of many open questions concerning evolutionary algorithms in general are pointed out.},
